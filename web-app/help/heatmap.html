  The "Heatmap" function plots the relative gene expression intensity levels of different genes
  across a population, or between two different populations. Different rows represent different
  genes (labeled on the left hand side). Different columns represent different subjects
  (labeled on the top). When plotting heatmaps for two subsets, subject names will be
  prepended with S1_ for subset 1 and S2_ for subset 2.<br><br>

  High intensity is represented by red ("very hot"), and low intensity is represented by
  blue ("very cold"). Missing values will be plotted as black. Intensity values are
  logarithmic; each change in shade represents a doubling of intensity.<br><br>

  Heatmaps can be used to quickly spot differences between populations; look for common
  colors within subsets but different colors between subsets to find interesting markers
  for further analysis.
